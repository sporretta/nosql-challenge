## About

The purpose of this project is to help a company answer some questions they have. We can read large sets of data and analyze it in an efficient way to draw conclusions and make recommendations.
This gives us practice in importing data from external sources and performing analysis on it to help make decisions with uk food. We can use nosql and compassDB to answer questions using a few lines of code.
